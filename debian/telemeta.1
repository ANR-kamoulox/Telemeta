.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the 
\fBtelemeta\fR command. 
.PP 
This manual page was written for the \fBDebian\fP distribution 
because the original program does not have a manual page. 
Instead, it has documentation in the GNU \fBInfo\fP format; see below. 
.PP 
\fBtelemeta\fR is an audio tool which creates audio transcoded databases fast from fresh mastered files. It can be useful to backup digitalized audio media from vinyls, old tapes or whatever. 
.PP 
Telemeta first creates a simple structure where original sounds will be backuped. The files can be transcoded to WAV, FLAC, MP3 and OGG including the corresponding tags. 
.PP 
Here are some cool functions: 
.IP "\fB\fP" 10 
\- XML generation for metadata tags of backuped WAV 
.IP "" 10 
\- Audio marking from a given file or from tags thanks to the Festival speech systhesis tool 
.IP "" 10 
\- File corruption security with par2 recovery files 
.IP "" 10 
\- Database synchronizing to remote servers (ssh+rsync) 
.IP "" 10 
\- Modify metadata from XML or interactive shell
