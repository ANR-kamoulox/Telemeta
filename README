Telemeta: backups, transcodes, tags and marks any audio content with metadata


# 1. Introduction
# ===============

Telemeta is an audio tool which creates audio transcoded databases fast from fresh mastered files. It can be useful to backup digitalized audio media from vinyls, old tapes or whatever.

Telemeta first creates a simple structure where original sounds will be backuped. The files can be transcoded to WAV, FLAC, MP3 and OGG including the corresponding tags.

Here are some cool functions:

  - XML generation for metadata tags of backuped WAV
  - Audio marking from a given file or from tags thanks to the Festival speech systhesis tool
  - File corruption security with par2 recovery files
  - Database synchronizing to remote servers (ssh+rsync)
  - Modify metadata from XML or interactive shell


# 2. Requirements
# ===============

python (>= 2.3.5-7), python-xml, python-central (>= 0.5), python-mutagen, sox, vorbis-tools, flac, lame, normalize-audio, ecasound, festival, par2


# 3. Installation
# ===============

Telemeta is written in python. So it doesn't require any compilation step.

On debian or Ubuntu just add these lines to your /etc/apt/sources-list:

	deb http://yomix.org/debian/ binary/
	deb-src http://yomix.org/debian/ source/

Then,

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install telemeta

On other linux platforms, uncompress the archive, go into the created directory and just type this with your favorite shell :

	python install.py

See INSTALL file for more informations.


# 4. Usage
# ========

In order to backup all original or transcoded files into a collection, telemeta needs first to create his repository. Let's type :

	telemeta --create COLLECTION

Replacing COLLECTION with the name of your collection. Answer to the questions. A target directory is then created. All answers are saved into YOUR_HOME/.telemeta/default_database.xml and YOUR_HOME/.telemeta/COLLECTION.xml

To backup a wav file, type :

	telemeta --backup COLLECTION FILE.WAV

where you have to replace FILE.WAV by the local file of your choice you want to add in the database. Then, answer to the questions. All answers are saved into YOUR_HOME/.telemeta/default_tags.xml and will be use for the next execution. The program will automatically transcode the wav (or aiff) file to the types you have defined (for example FLAC, MP3 and/or OGG) and place them into each directory of the repository (for example flac/, mp3/ and/or ogg/).

To backup an entire directory, type :

	telemeta --backup COLLECTION --album DIRECTORY

where you have to replace DIRECTORY by the local directory containing all the audio files you want to add in the database.

Other options:

	--from-xml     takes tags and opts in original xml source
	--force        forces file conversion (no audio test)
	--par2         forces par2 file creation
	--all-default  chooses default argument for all question
	--recover      check an repair the backuped media with the previously created "par2" security key
	--rsync        synchronizes database to a remote server (ssh+rsync)
	--erase-media  erases the media (flac, ogg, mp3) database
	--help         gives help page

# 5. EXAMPLES
# ===========

	telemeta --create my_collection
	telemeta --backup my_collection file.wav
	telemeta --backup my_collection --album ./
	telemeta --backup my_collection --album --par2 --rsync ./
	telemeta --backup my_collection --album --par2 --rsync --force ./ \n

# 6. TODO
# =======

- HTTP web interface (metadata adding, editing, uploading, searching)
- debug id3 editing
- add media types
- create svn repository
