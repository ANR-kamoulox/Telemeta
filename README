Telemeta: web frontend to backup, transcode and tag any audio content with metadata


Introduction
============

Telemeta is a global audio archiving program which introduces useful and secure
indexing methods to backup digitalized audio files and metadata dictionnaries.
It is dedicated to backup any digitized and documented sound from collections of
vinyls, magnetic tapes or audio CD over a strong database in accordance with
many standards. Export functions also encapsulate edited metadata into
compressed file. The object style architecture will soon provide user-friendly
interfaces and plugin' style audio processing.

Here are the main features of Telemeta: 

    * Secure media editing and archiving over networks.
    * Easy transcoding
    * Full tagging and marking methods
    * XML metadata backup
    * Web interface introducing WorkFlow.
    * SQL backend (still in dev from march 2007).
    * Data anti-corruption security with par2 recovery keys
    * Data synchronizing over remote servers (rsync)
    * Auto AudioMarking? from metadata (thanks to Festival and Ecasound) 

The Telemeta concept is based on collections. A collection includes original
sounds - or albums containing sounds - which will be backuped in a secure way
with a view of transcoded 'public' formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG and many more
soon...) including metadata editing and publishing tools.
