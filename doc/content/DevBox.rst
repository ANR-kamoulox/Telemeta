Telemeta has been dockerized!
#############################

:category: Development

Only 1 month after the publication of the `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ tools by `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and after 1 month more of hard development and test by the Parisson team, we are very pleased to launch the docker based distribution of Telemeta which should make it compatible with **ANY** platform.

To test, use, develop or even deploy your own Telemeta based project, please use our `DevBox <https://github.com/Parisson/DevBox>`_.

For more infos about our docker images, please check the `Parisson registry <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/parisson/>`_

NB: we need so more tweaks and tests on OSX, please ping us if you need to try the DevBox on this platform.
