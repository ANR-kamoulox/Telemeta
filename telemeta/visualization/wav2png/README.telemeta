Telemeta notes:

This is the (slighly modified) GPL'ed wav2png program that generates waveform 
at freesound, downloaded from: 
http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/files/wav2png.tar.gz

It is used by the initial Telemeta WaveformVisualizer.

You need the libgd and libsndfile libraries to compile it. 

You also need anyoption.h and anyoption.cpp from:
http://www.hackorama.com/anyoption/

Then simply type:

$ make
